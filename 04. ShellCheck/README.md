# ShellCheck CI Integration with GitHub Actions

## Overview

ShellCheck is a powerful static analysis tool for shell scripts. It provides warnings and suggestions to help identify and fix potential issues in `bash` and `sh` scripts. By integrating ShellCheck into your CI pipeline, you can ensure that your shell scripts are bug-free and adhere to best practices.

This documentation provides instructions on setting up ShellCheck in a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the static analysis of your shell scripts.

## Benefits of Using ShellCheck

- **Static Analysis:** Detects potential errors and code smells in shell scripts.
- **Automation:** Seamlessly integrates into CI pipelines for continuous monitoring.
- **Early Detection:** Alerts you to problems before they impact your workflow, by failing the CI job if issues are detected.

## Setting Up ShellCheck in GitHub Actions

To integrate ShellCheck with GitHub Actions, you need to create a workflow configuration file in your repository. Below is a sample workflow file that you can use as a template.

## Example GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a file named `.github/workflows/shellcheck.yml` in your repository and add the following configuration:

```yaml
name: ShellCheck

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  shellcheck:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install ShellCheck
        run: sudo apt-get install shellcheck

      - name: Run ShellCheck on Common Script
        run: shellcheck scripts/common.sh
        
      - name: Run ShellCheck on Master Script
        run: shellcheck scripts/master.sh
```

## Configuration Breakdown

- **Workflow Name:**
  ```yaml
  name: ShellCheck
  ```
  This sets the name of the workflow as "ShellCheck".

- **Triggers:**
  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main
    pull_request:
      branches:
        - main
  ```
  The workflow triggers on pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch.

- **Job Definition:**
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    shellcheck:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  ```
  Defines a job named `shellcheck` that runs on the latest Ubuntu environment.

### Job Steps

1. **Checkout Code:**
   ```yaml
   - name: Checkout code
     uses: actions/checkout@v2
   ```
   This step checks out your repository's code into the virtual environment.

2. **Install ShellCheck:**
   ```yaml
   - name: Install ShellCheck
     run: sudo apt-get install shellcheck
   ```
   Installs ShellCheck using the `apt-get` package manager.

3. **Run ShellCheck on `scripts/common.sh`:**
   ```yaml
   - name: Run ShellCheck on Common Script
     run: shellcheck scripts/common.sh
   ```
   Runs ShellCheck on the `scripts/common.sh` file to analyze it for issues.

4. **Run ShellCheck on `scripts/master.sh`:**
   ```yaml
   - name: Run ShellCheck on Master Script
     run: shellcheck scripts/master.sh
   ```
   Runs ShellCheck on the `scripts/master.sh` file similarly.

### Customization

Adjust the paths and filenames in the `run` commands to match the structure of your repository. You can add or remove scripts as needed.

### Conclusion

By integrating ShellCheck into your GitHub Actions CI pipeline, you can automate the process of detecting and fixing issues in your shell scripts. This ensures higher code quality and reduces the risk of introducing bugs into your workflow. Implementing this setup will help you maintain robust and reliable shell scripts in your projects.
